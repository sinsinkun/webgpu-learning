# webgpu-learning

Learning project for WebGPU, a modern graphics API specifically designed for browsers to take advantage
of GPUs for both rendering and computation. An improvement over the old WebGL standard for web, with some new
features like computation shaders and storage buffers that aren't available from OpenGL APIs.

Also first project with Bun server instead of node.

Followed the tutorial from 
[https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app)
 with some personal touches, lessons/habits learned from working with OpenGL libraries.
